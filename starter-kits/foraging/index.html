Black Forager on TikTok and instagram is a great starting point.

she’s incredibly informative, inspiring, and funny




  Books, general foraging
  #


Northeast Foraging, if you live in the northeast of the US this book is the perfect starter book. you can read over what’s available in your area and then start looking for it.

this was my first foraging book and i ate tons of stuff around boston using this book


there are books from the same series for other regions, e.g. midwest foraging.


  Books, mushrooms
  #


Mushrooming without Fear

extreme beginner book, makes sure every shroom is from a completely non toxic family. so it’s impossible to get poisonous mushrooms if you’re following everything in the book


Mushrooming with Confidence

book by the same author. i think of this as the intermediate book that you’d read after mushrooming without fear.




  identification

    🌿
    Foraging Tip
  
  
    
**Golden Rule**: Always have 3 forms of positive ID before eating anything!

  




always have 3 forms of positive ID.
even then, taste test. only eat a little (tbh see if you have a bad digestive reaction). look up if it needs to be cooked first.


  
  Safety First!
  
  
  ⚠️
  
  
    
Even with proper identification, start with small amounts to test for allergic reactions. Some edible plants require cooking to be safe!

  




  the three forms of identification i use
  #


foraging books
Seek app by iNaturalist or Google Lens, these are helpful but not 100% reliable. ALWAYS check another form of ID.
facebook foraging groups, local to you (literally search on FB: foraging <location> or foraging and identification <location>

For Massachusetts people:

Foraging Southern New England
Foraging with Friends RI/MA/CT
The New England Mushroom Identification Forum




google “green leaves with white undersides massachusetts”
google whatever you think you have found thru apps or books and TRIPLE CHECK ALL IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS ARE THE SAME

if you’re unsure at all DO NOT EAT"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#ffffff"><meta name=theme-color media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#343a40"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:url" content="https://mattekir.win/starter-kits/foraging/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="mattekir.win"><meta property="og:title" content="foraging starter kit"><meta property="og:description" content="foraging starter kit # so you want to eat stuff outside? # by Matte Kirwin
